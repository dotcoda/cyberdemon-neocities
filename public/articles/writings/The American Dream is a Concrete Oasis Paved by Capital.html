                    Over the last 150 years, the development of American cities has been shaped less by deliberate
                    planning and more by the relentless pursuit of profit. Urban reformers and planners often envisioned
                    more equitable, livable spaces, but their efforts were frequently overridden by powerful
                    corporations and policymakers motivated by economic gain. As cities expanded rapidly in the late
                    nineteenth century, particularly with the influx of immigrant labor, developers prioritized profit
                    over the welfare of workers, creating overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions. Rather than
                    implementing inclusive, public health-driven infrastructure, city governments enabled the
                    exploitation of the poor, embedding inequality into urban policies. By the early twentieth century,
                    zoning laws, originally intended to mitigate overcrowding and improve living conditions, were
                    co-opted by business interests to preserve property values and isolate communities. This trend
                    continues today, where suburbanization and privatized urban development reflect the growing
                    dominance of capital in shaping the built environment. Rather than serving the public good, urban
                    planning increasingly became a tool for maintaining class divisions and maximizing corporate
                    profits. </p>
                <p>
                    The late nineteenth century saw a rapid increase in population in cities, prompting people to change
                    their way of life around it. In 1800, only around 4% of the population lived in cities, but at the
                    turn of the century, that number had reached 33%. This new population boom consisted primarily of
                    immigrants seeking industrial jobs. With an influx of people, space became a rarity, and immigrants
                    had no choice but to live in tenement housing, often with other families. These houses were dense
                    and overcrowded, with no direct sunlight or plumbing (Gillette 6). Despite major cities having
                    nearly 25,000 miles of underground sewage systems by 1909, this service was only given to those who
                    could afford it. Even though water was paid for with tax dollars, property owners had to request
                    sewage systems, placing the well-being of tenants at the mercy of landlords more concerned with
                    profit than public health. (Steinberg 164). Many property owners choose to avoid the added expense,
                    opting instead to let their tenants endure unsanitary and dangerous conditions. The influx of
                    immigrants and subsequent housing shortages set up the conditions for exploitation and minimal
                    investment in adequate living conditions. Tenements were not designed for livability; they were
                    crammed in for profit. The sewage infrastructure of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                    centuries reflects a pattern where planning was not absent, but rather hijacked by capital
                    interests. City governments did not fail to build infrastructure—they built thousands of miles of
                    underground sewage systems. Rather than creating inclusive systems that met the needs of a growing
                    urban population, the city enabled the exploitation of the working poor by embedding inequality
                    directly into its policies. This closed-loop system reflected a strange irony: the waste of the
                    poorest city dwellers sustained the food systems that would ultimately feed the very society that
                    refused them proper sanitation. It was an economy of necessity, not design, and one driven by
                    survival rather than civic planning. </p>
                <p>
                    The city’s failure to enforce equitable sanitation systems turned poor neighborhoods into dumping
                    grounds, where waste management took on self-sustaining forms. In overcrowded tenement districts,
                    human waste was often thrown directly from windows into the streets below. The streets were not
                    filled only with human waste, but animal waste as well. Immigrant families often kept freely roaming
                    pigs as economic security, who would scavenge for trash and produce their own waste in turn,
                    resulting in an urban common of sorts (Steinberg 157). This filth, known as night soil, did not go
                    to waste. By 1880, nearly half of all major cities in the United States used night soil to on their
                    land or sold it to dealers who made it into fertilizer. This fertilizer was then shipped to farmers
                    who, in turn, would use it on their crops that would be sent back to the city for consumption
                    (Steinberg 163). </p>
                <p>
                    Ironically, this problem due to a lack of plumbing would stop due to water. Poor working families
                    that could not afford to buy a home with a connected sewage system could also not afford fresh
                    water. Urbanites relied on wells that, as populations rose, became contaminated with disease from
                    increasing manure, and progressivists focused on beautifying the city. A significant contributor to
                    the issue of manure was the roaming pigs. In the late nineteenth century, reforms were passed
                    prohibiting the owning of wandering pigs, and soon the animals were driven out of the city. With the
                    pigs gone, poor families had no economic security and were forced to rely on the cash economy.
                    Surrounding farmers also lost their source of manure and began turning to artificial means to
                    fertilize their crops. To replace the hogs, the city hired municipal garbage collectors, despite
                    resistance from poor families who had previously relied on selling the trash as hog feed. Initially,
                    garbage collection was left to the discretion of individual wards. However, when residents pushed
                    back against the new system, health officials intervened and implemented citywide garbage
                    collection. (Steinberg 166). Even attempts at informal planning by the poor were undermined by
                    policies serving other economic classes. </p>
                <p>
                    The Progressive Era laid the groundwork for modern urban growth, offering an early vision of how
                    cities might be improved through deliberate planning. Cities in the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth centuries had grown too fast and were overrun with problems: overcrowded housing, rampant
                    disease, unsafe working conditions, and a widening gap between rich and poor. Progressives believed
                    these issues were not just natural outcomes of industrialization, they were problems that could be
                    fixed through deliberate, thoughtful planning. It was the belief that the environment citizens lived
                    in had a strong influence on their behavior, morals, and well-being. A good, structured surrounding
                    would inspire moral and civic improvement among a city’s residents. In addition to advocating for
                    clean water, waste removal, and better public health systems, progressive reformers aimed to improve
                    living conditions in tenement housing. In 1901, new legislation in New York required housing to have
                    minimum standards for light and provide running water (Gillette 9). The success of the regulatory
                    efforts in New York would lead to other major US cities introducing their own laws. While these
                    reforms were rooted in social ideals, they also laid the foundation for zoning laws. What began as a
                    Progressive tool for social reform was increasingly shaped by the profit motive, revealing the
                    limits of planning when it battles against economic power. </p>
                <p>
                    Planners initially intended zoning to combat the problem of overcrowding within tenements, aiming to
                    introduce separate low-density housing and industrial districts in hopes of improving the quality of
                    life while also rationalizing land use. While Progressive-era planners envisioned neighborhoods as
                    tools for social reform and civic well-being, their ideas were quickly co-opted by zoning policies
                    aligned with profit-driven interests. What started as an idea for social reform became, in many
                    places, a tool to maintain class divides and protect capital. Rather than fostering diverse,
                    integrated communities, zoning became a mechanism to preserve property values and appeal to middle-
                    and upper-middle-class homeowners. As the 1930s approached, business owners realized they could
                    profit from investing in the development of deteriorated areas and began private investments in
                    suburban neighborhoods. (Gillette 69) This marked a shift in values from its civic concern in the
                    progressive era to the protection of business and revenue growth. Fully planned neighborhoods were
                    only for those who could afford them, and low-income areas were cleared. The government encouraged
                    companies to invest in projects by providing them with long-term, low-interest loans at low interest
                    rates. This shift marked the growing dominance of capital in shaping the built environment, one that
                    only accelerated in the postwar era as new forms of retail and transportation infrastructure emerged
                    to serve the needs of capital. </p>
                <p>As this market-driven approach to zoning took hold, the rise of car-centered retail in the postwar
                    era deepened the divide between civic planning and economic interest. Rather than developing
                    integrated, walkable communities, retailers and developers pursued locations that maximized
                    accessibility by automobile, not proximity to residents. Development was redefined to
                    “car-orientated” development, notably due to the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which funded 90%
                    of a 41,000-mile superhighway designed by engineers with no input from city planners (Wells 254).
                    Branch stores and shopping centers followed, often located at intersections of major roads or along
                    new highways, where visibility and access for drivers promised higher profits (Wells 262–265).
                    Municipal zoning reinforced this shift by requiring off-street parking in fixed ratios to retail
                    floor space, encouraging a design standard that assumed all customers would arrive by car. The
                    physical design of these spaces, dominated by expansive parking lots and anchored by chain stores,
                    reflected the growing consensus that profitability hinged on automotive convenience. The automobile
                    itself became one of capitalism’s most powerful tools for reshaping urban space, serving not only as
                    a mode of transportation but as a mechanism for expanding markets and driving consumer behavior.
                    These retail landscapes, shaped almost entirely by the logic of capital, reveal just how thoroughly
                    profit came to dictate the form and function of American cities. </p>
                <p>Over the past 150 years, cities have grown not through thoughtful, inclusive planning, but through
                    decisions driven primarily by profit. While planners and reformers occasionally pushed for
                    healthier, more equitable urban environments, their efforts were frequently constrained, redirected,
                    or undone by the interests of capital. From overcrowded tenements to manipulated zoning laws, and
                    selective infrastructure investment to the rise of profit-oriented suburbanization, economic
                    self-interest has consistently dictated the physical and social structure of urban life. Rather than
                    serving the public good, planning often became a tool to reinforce inequality and maximize return on
                    investment. If future urban development is to serve the many instead of the few, it must reassert
                    planning not as a servant of capital, but as a means of creating more just, sustainable, and
                    inclusive spaces for all. </p>
