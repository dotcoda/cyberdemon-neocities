                    oh boy long update. in chronological order: my bee eff and i
                    went to the nature reserve recently :3 i bought some minnows
                    that the ichthyology club was selling for valentines day. you
                    could buy a fish and name it after a lover and they would live
                    in the tank at the welcome center so i bought two fish and named
                    them bren and coda &#60;&#62;&#60; we went to go see them in the
                    tank and i bought a little butterfly keychain for my bag :3
                    second: we also went hiking in the forest and found a cool
                    little ditch :33 we laid down in it for like 30 minutes. third:
                    i had an hrt consult with a doctor in the student health service
                    she was really nice. i can start T as soon as my next visit and
                    the prices are hella cheap. fourth: midterms have been kicking
                    my ass. on tuesday i have a final for my java class ON PAPER. it
                    was hell. i got an 88. then i had a psych final which i totally
                    bombed. and now i have to do another final for my html class. on
                    top of that i had to do a coding assessment for a job offer and
                    FUCK THAT. WHAT THE HELL IS SQL. fifth? i had a job interview
                    for a campus job today too. i think it went well the person was
                    really nice. i hope i get the job its a graphic design position
                    and it sounds really fun. ok. i think im done ...... üê∂

                    oh boy its time for another (drumroll please) long update !!
                    yayy first one with my new layout !! i started a new job
                    recently its kind of mehhhh. on one hand its a really good job
                    and it pays well and the people there are really nice and its
                    very good expirience. on the other hand .. i am Severly Sleepy
                    (chronic fatigue) and having to wake up so early and force
                    myself to work for so long only makes me worse. and i have no
                    time in the day i have 8 hours for work, 8 for sleep, 1 for
                    commuting, 1 for eating, 1 for getting ready, 2 for naps which
                    only leaves me 2 hours in a day to do whatever and that isnt
                    enough to do ANYTHING. the only reason im getting the time to
                    write this currently is because its a rare day for me where i
                    have 2 monsters and skip my nap. AND I MISS MY BOYFRIEND. so
                    much. this is not living. <br />
                    <br />
                    and i saw a baby deer yesterday he had little spots

                    to go back home for a doctors appointment and *hopefully* they
                    can find something wrong with me and i can get a prescription.
                    otherwise its either a sleep disorder and ill have to take a

                    first post back in college! hooray!! ive been meaning to write a
                    blog post for some time but i just never got around to it >_
                    < not much has changed from last year. i love my roommate i love my friends i love my room i love my
                      classes (most of them) <br />
                    <br />
                    OH MY GOD. i wrote a paper for one of my media studies classes
                    and got a C on it. the teachers notes on it were EXACTLY WHAT I
                    SAID (but less articulate) AND SHE USED THE SAME DAMN EXACT
                    QUOTATIONS AS I DID?? anyways. i LOVE my other media studies
                    class so much. i love being able to talk about film and its
                    components and how much i love technicolor AND HAVE PEOPLE
                    UNDERSTAND ME!! AND I LOVE MY TEACHER shes so silly!! she knows
                    about the view askewniverse too :33 the building that class is
                    in is so cool too. its one of the older buildings on campus and
                    its all for media studies. our college radio station is in that
                    building and i just think its so cool. on every floor theres
                    displays for like merchandice from media and they have a whole
                    display on just the x-files its SO COOL!! OMG THEY ALSO HAVE A
                    WHOLE KODAK COLLECTION. I LOVE IT SO SO SO MUCH. it awes my
                    tism<br /><br />

                    because i just feel like they have a metaphorical knife held
                    behind their back the whole time. i feel like theyre just slowly
                    trying to distance themselves from me but cant get rid of me.

                    hi again! its been a long time. i have been so busy and so depressed but im finally back! i'm
                    getting ready to move into my first apartment and to start my first webedv job! everything is
                    coming together but it took so long to get here
                    <br><br>
                    in like may or so i tried to re-apply to the company i had taken medical leave from and thats when
                    everything started to fall apart basically <span class="emoji">&#xE029;</span> i went through the
                    entire rehiring process after being told that the position would be held for me when i first left
                    only to get rejected... its ok now because i am starting to do web
                    page contracting! i meet with my first client soon and we are both very excited <span
                      class="emoji">&#57382;</span>
                    <br><br>
                    during this time, i (as you can see) updated my website! it was a pain trying to reformat everything
                    but i like it so much better now. i also made a professional portfolio for a class midterm last
                    school year and got to mess around with sass, bootstrap, and node! i have also been browsing github
                    like its a social media...
                    <br><br>
                    as for now... ive been getting the desire to draw again!! my boyfriend had some crayolas and an
                    empty notebook at his new apartment and now i cant stop doodling. i have so many art ideas i want
                    to do... if only i could find my art supplies..
                    <br>
                    i have also been playing too much tiny glade since i am finally not on a mac! love playing it and
                    watching something on my second monitor for like 3 hours <span class="emoji">&#9728;</span>
                    <br><br>
                    and for the future... aside from my new job next week my boyfriend, our friend and i are going to
                    the ren faire! i haven't been in so long... i think the last time was either with my dad (:/) or the
                    4th grade with my friend that moved the next year so im excited to go again! <br>
                    i am also looking forward to decorating my apartment. my grandma gave me the most beautiful stereo
                    cabinet that used to be my grandpa's beore they moved off of the farm so its been sitting in her
                    basement for years. the only condition on me taking it was that i take his polka records too so i
                    guess my roommate is going to learn to love them (sorry zoe LOL). theres a perfect spot in my
                    apartment for it too. cant wait to play my fonzie record.
                    <br><br>
                    i think thats mostly it.... hopefully it won't be another 8 months again! <span

                   told you it wouldnt be another 8 months! i just got back from a trip to rhode island. it was so odd being there as a midwesterner. ive never been right next to the ocean and the seagulls there were FUCKING MASSIVE. like two times the size of chicago ones. i also saw a type of crow ive never seen before (fish crow) they sounded so weird. the birds and the lighthouses were the only good parts though i did nooooott like the culture there. "culture" i have never seen people so egregiously wealthy like these people were european old money wealthy. like clubs you cant get into unless your dad's dad's grandpa's lineage could be tracked to british royalty on both sides. like these people have multi-million-dollar double-digit-bedroom mansions they call summer cottages that they stay in for two months then forget about until next year. fucking absurd. dont get me started on the yachts and the 30 year boat parking waitlist im so serious.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   anyways... i started my job! after i met with my first client they recomended me to ANOTHER PERSON <span class="emoji">&#57382;</span>! now ive got two projects lined up and im in the process of starting my own buisness .... insanity. all this to say i have learned so much coding in the past few weeks that i can hardly look at this sites code... version 4.5 will appear at random like a fnaf jumpscare <3
