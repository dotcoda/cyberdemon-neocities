              oh boy long update. in chronological order: my bee eff and i
              went to the nature reserve recently :3 i bought some minnows
              that the ichthyology club was selling for valentines day. you
              could buy a fish and name it after a lover and they would live
              in the tank at the welcome center so i bought two fish and named
              them bren and coda &#60;&#62;&#60; we went to go see them in the
              tank and i bought a little butterfly keychain for my bag :3
              second: we also went hiking in the forest and found a cool
              little ditch :33 we laid down in it for like 30 minutes. third:
              i had an hrt consult with a doctor in the student health service
              she was really nice. i can start T as soon as my next visit and
              the prices are hella cheap. fourth: midterms have been kicking
              my ass. on tuesday i have a final for my java class ON PAPER. it
              was hell. i got an 88. then i had a psych final which i totally
              bombed. and now i have to do another final for my html class. on
              top of that i had to do a coding assessment for a job offer and
              FUCK THAT. WHAT THE HELL IS SQL. fifth? i had a job interview
              for a campus job today too. i think it went well the person was
              really nice. i hope i get the job its a graphic design position
              and it sounds really fun. ok. i think im done ...... 🐶

              oh boy its time for another (drumroll please) long update !!
              yayy first one with my new layout !! i started a new job
              recently its kind of mehhhh. on one hand its a really good job
              and it pays well and the people there are really nice and its
              very good expirience. on the other hand .. i am Severly Sleepy
              (chronic fatigue) and having to wake up so early and force
              myself to work for so long only makes me worse. and i have no
              time in the day i have 8 hours for work, 8 for sleep, 1 for
              commuting, 1 for eating, 1 for getting ready, 2 for naps which
              only leaves me 2 hours in a day to do whatever and that isnt
              enough to do ANYTHING. the only reason im getting the time to
              write this currently is because its a rare day for me where i
              have 2 monsters and skip my nap. AND I MISS MY BOYFRIEND. so
              much. this is not living. <br />
              <br />
              and i saw a baby deer yesterday he had little spots

              OH MY GOD. i wrote a paper for one of my media studies classes
              and got a C on it. the teachers notes on it were EXACTLY WHAT I
              SAID (but less articulate) AND SHE USED THE SAME DAMN EXACT
              QUOTATIONS AS I DID?? anyways. i LOVE my other media studies
              class so much. i love being able to talk about film and its
              components and how much i love technicolor AND HAVE PEOPLE
              UNDERSTAND ME!! AND I LOVE MY TEACHER shes so silly!! she knows
              about the view askewniverse too :33 the building that class is
              in is so cool too. its one of the older buildings on campus and
              its all for media studies. our college radio station is in that
              building and i just think its so cool. on every floor theres
              displays for like merchandice from media and they have a whole
              display on just the x-files its SO COOL!! OMG THEY ALSO HAVE A
